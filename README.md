# Data-Omega-LGBT-Survey-Analysis
Data Challenge - June 2022 Celebrating #PrideMonth


I learned about a challenge that is open till July 4 2022 after visiting [Data Omega](https://www.dataomega.in/)'s website. Immediately jumped in, and the task was to create a dashboard for the analysis of the [LGBT Survey](https://www.dataomega.in/datachallenge/data-challenge---june-2022).

Here is a [link](https://www.dataomega.in/datachallenge/data-challenge---june-2022) to information about the competition.
#### About the Survey
To find out how lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) residents of Croatia and the European Union (EU) feel about the realisation of their basic rights, FRA (Fundamental Rights Agency) undertook an online poll.

The survey's data will be used to promote the creation of legislation and policies that will better combat harassment, violence, and discrimination while promoting equality in society. After the first FRA report on homophobia and discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity was published in 2009, which emphasised the lack of comparable data, the necessity for such an EU-wide survey became clear.

The European Commission then asked FRA to gather comparable statistics on this issue for the EU as a whole. All EU Member States as well as Croatia were included in the online poll that FRA prepared for the data gathering. Anonymous respondents who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender who are at least 18 years old made up the respondents.

From April to July 2012, the poll was made available online in Catalan, Croatian, Luxembourgish, Russian, and Turkish in addition to the 23 official EU languages (excluding Irish). A total of 93,079 LGBT people responded to the study.

The poll was created by internal FRA specialists and executed by Gallup, a market leader in extensive surveys. Additionally, civil society groups like Transgender Europe (TGEU) and ILGA-Europe (European Region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association) provide guidance on how to approach LGBT individuals.
